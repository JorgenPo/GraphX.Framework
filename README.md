#Welcome to the GraphX.Framework wiki!

##What is it?
GraphX - is very simply framework based on SDL. In begin it was created for studying purposes. But now I want to develop this code and make it usefull for my friends and people on GitHub. If you want to use it, or just participate developing proccess - welcome to GraphX.Framework developers!

##How can I use it?
Since GraphX just developing, now it is take some time to set up the framework. But with this expicit tutorial you should be able to do this easely.

###Setting up framework on Visual Studio (2015)
1. Clone this repository.
2. Move GraphX.Framework.zip to your VS templates dir ({VS path}/My Exported Templates).
3. Open Visual Studio and create new project from GraphX.Framework template.
4. Today, if you want use GraphX, you need to download and set up SDL library (last version). How to do this you can find on web. Official SDL site is: www.libsdl.org.
5. All is done! Now you can create your app using GraphX.Framework. Try to run it!

###Parts of framework
If you look to Solution Explorer you see couple of files here. GraphX.h and GraphX.cpp and main.cpp is core files - you shouldn't touch this files. Your working class lie in XApplication.h/.cpp files. Since all framework is well-documented you will be familliar with framework by time.

##Collaborate!
This is a full open-source project. Any person can improve it! See Issues link, to see what you can do right now!
But there are some rules for participants, describing code style in project. All rules lie in wiki-page "Code style"
